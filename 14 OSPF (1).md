An area is a set of routers and links that share the same LSDB. 
● The backbone area (area 0) is an area that all other areas must connect to. 
● Routers with all interfaces in the same area are called internal routers. 
● Routers with interfaces in multiple areas are called area border routers (ABRs). 
● Routers connected to the backbone area (area 0) are called backbone routers. 
● An intra-area route is a route to a destination inside the same OSPF area. 
● An interarea route is a route to a destination in a different OSPF area.
