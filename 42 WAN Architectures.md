###  WAN Architectures  

● WAN stands for Wide Area Network.

● Although the Internet itself can be considered a WAN, the term WAN is typically used to refer to an enterprise’s private connections that connect their offices, data centers, and other sites together.

● Over public/shared networks like the Internet, VPNs (Virtual Private Networks) can be used to create private WAN connections.
