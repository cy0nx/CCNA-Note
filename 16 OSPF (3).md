Serial Interfaces:
● The default encapsulation is HDLC. 
● You can configure PPP encapsulation with this command: R1(config-if)# encapsulation ppp 
● One side is DCE, one side is DTE. 
● Identify which side is DCE/DTE: R1# show controllers interface-id 
● You must configure the clock rate on the DCE side: R1(config-if)# clock rate bits-per-second

OSPF Neighbor Requirements:
1) Area number must match 
2) Interfaces must be in the same subnet 
3) OSPF process must not be shutdown 
4) OSPF Router IDs must be unique 
5) Hello and Dead timers must match 
6) Authentication settings must match 
7) IP MTU settings must match 
8) OSPF Network Type must match


OSPF LSA Types:
● Type 1 (Router LSA) 
-Every OSPF router generates this type of LSA. -It identifies the router using its router ID. -It also lists networks attached to the router’s OSPF-activated interfaces. 

● Type 2 (Network LSA) 
-Generated by the DR of each ‘multi-access’ network (ie. the broadcast network type). -Lists the routers which are attached to the multi-access network. 

● Type 5 (AS-External LSA) 
-Generated by ASBRs to describe routes to destinations outside of the AS (OSPF domain).
