● Ansible is a configuration management tool owned by Red Hat.

● Ansible itself is written in Python.

● Ansible is agentless.  
→It doesn’t require any special software to run on the managed devices.

● Ansible uses SSH to connect to devices, make configuration changes, extract information, etc.

● Ansible uses a push model. The Ansible server (Control node) uses SSH to connect to managed devices and push configuration changes to them.  
→Puppet and Chef use a pull model.

● After installing Ansible itself, you must create several text files:  
→**Playbooks**: These are files are ‘blueprints of automation tasks’. They outline the logic and actions of the tasks that Ansible should do. Written in YAML.  
→**Inventory**: These files list the devices that will be managed by Ansible, as well as characteristics of each device such as their device role (access switch, core switch, WAN router, firewall, etc). Written in INI, YAML, or other formats.    
→**Templates**: These files represent a device’s configuration file, but specific values for variables are not provided. Written in Jinja2 format.    
→**Variables**: These files list variables and their values. These values are substituted into the templates to create complete configuration files. Written in YAML.

● Puppet is a configuration management tool written in Ruby.

● Puppet is typically agent-based.  
→Specific software must be installed on the managed devices.  
→Not all Cisco devices support a Puppet agent.

● It can be run agentless, in which a proxy agent runs on an external host, and the proxy agent uses SSH to connect to the managed devices and communicate with them.

● The Puppet server is called the ‘Puppet master’.

● Puppet uses a pull model (clients ‘pull’ configurations from the Puppet master).  
→Clients use TCP 8140 to communicate with the Puppet master.

● Instead of YAML, it uses a proprietary language for files.

● Text files required on the Puppet master include:  
→**Manifest**: This file defines the desired configuration state of a network device.  
→**Templates**: Similar to Ansible templates. Used to generate Manifests.

##  Chef

● Chef is a configuration management tool written in Ruby.

● Chef is agent-based.  
→Specific software must be installed on the managed devices.  
→Not all Cisco devices support a Chef agent.

● Chef uses a pull model.

● The server uses TCP 10002 to send configurations to clients.

● Files use a DSL (Domain-Specific Language) based on Ruby.

● Text files used by Chef include:  
→**Resources**: The ‘ingredients’ in a recipe. Configuration objects managed by Chef.  
→**Recipes**: The ‘recipes’ in a cookbook. Outline the logic and actions of the tasks performed on the resources.  
→**Cookbooks**: A set of related recipes grouped together.  
→**Run-list**: An ordered list of recipes that are run to bring a device to the desired configuration state.
