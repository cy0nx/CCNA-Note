● The purpose of QoS is to give certain kinds of network traffic priority over others during congestion.

→ NBAR (Network Based Application Recognition) performs a deep packet inspection, looking beyond the Layer 3 and Layer 4 information up to Layer 7 to identify the specific kind of traffic.

Layer 2 header field can be used for QoS markings:

The PCP (Priority Code Point) field of the 802.1Q tag (in the Ethernet header) can be used to identify high/low priority traffic.
→Only when there is a dot1q tag!
