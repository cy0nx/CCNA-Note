Global unicast IPv6 addresses are public addresses

Originally defined as the 2000::/3 block (2000:: to 3FFF:FFFF:FFFF:FFFF:FFFF:FFFF:FFFF:FFFF).

Unique local IPv6 addresses are private addresses

Uses the address block FC00::/7 (FC00:: to FDFF:FFFF:FFFF:FFFF:FFFF:FFFF:FFFF:FFFF)

Link-local IPv6 addresses are automatically generated on IPv6-enabled interfaces.

Uses the address block FE80::/10 (FE80:: to FEBF:FFFF:FFFF:FFFF:FFFF:FFFF:FFFF:FFFF).

```R1(config-if)# ipv6 enable```

Multicast addresses are one-to-many.

IPv6 uses range FF00::/8 for multicast. (FF00:: to FFFF:FFFF:FFFF:FFFF:FFFF:FFFF:FFFF:FFFF)

Interface-local (FF01): The packet doesnâ€™t leave the local device.

Link-local (FF02): The packet remains in the local subnet.

Site-local (FF05): The packet can be forwarded by routers.

Organization-local (FF08): Wider in scope than site-local (an entire company/organization).

Global (FF0E): No boundaries. Possible to be routed over the Internet.
